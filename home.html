    <p class="from-them" style="--delay: 0s;">Hello Customer 500601 &#128150;. Thank you for contacting Memories Train Service (MTS). How can we help you?</p>
    <p class="from-me" style="--delay: 1s;">Hi there! I heard about this Memories Train service and how it lets you visit your past memories.</p>
    <p class="from-me" style="--delay: 2s;">Is that true?</p>
    <p class="from-them"  style="--delay: 4s;">Yes, it's absolutely true &#128522;. We offer a unique experience where you can revisit your cherished memories. It's like taking a trip down memory lane.</p>
    <p class="from-me" style="--delay: 6s;"> Hmm, sounds interesting.</p>
    <p class="from-me" style="--delay: 7s;">How does it work?</p>
    <p class="from-them" style="--delay: 9s;">It's quite simple, really. We provide a unique service where you can purchase a ticket for our Memory Train.</p>
    <p class="from-them" style="--delay: 10s;">The train will take you to different moments in your life, allowing you to relive them as if they were happening again.</p>
    <p class="from-me emoji" style="--delay: 12s;">&#129300;</p>
    <p class="from-me" style="--delay: 13s;">That sounds almost too good to be true. How do you access someone's memories like that?</p>
    <p class="from-them" style="--delay: 15s;">Our advanced technology captures and recreates the neural patterns associated with your memories.</p>
    <p class="from-them" style="--delay: 16s;">It's completely safe and non-invasive. We prioritize privacy and ensure that only the memories you choose to revisit are accessible.</p>
    <p class="from-me" style="--delay: 18s;">I don't know, it just seems a bit... sci-fi, you know? Are you sure this is all legit? Btw, what if something goes wrong, or I end up seeing something I'd rather forget?</p>
    <p class="from-them" style="--delay: 20s;">We understand your concerns, and we take privacy very seriously. Our technology is cutting-edge, and our customers have had incredible experiences. You can read testimonials on our website if you'd like.</p>
    <p class="from-them" style="--delay: 21s;">We've implemented strict safety protocols, and our team is here to guide you throughout the journey. You have control over which memories you want to explore, and our system is designed to prioritize positive and meaningful experiences.</p>
    <p class="from-me emoji" style="--delay: 23s;">&#128077;</p>
    <p class="from-me" style="--delay: 24s;">Alright, I'll give it a shot. But how can I be sure this isn't some elaborate scam?</p>
    <p class="from-them" style="--delay: 26s;">We completely understand your concerns. To assure you, we offer a money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with the experience or if there are any issues, we'll refund your ticket price, no questions asked.</p>
    <p class="from-me" style="--delay: 28s;">Fair enough. I guess I'll take a chance and give it a try. How do I get started and how much is the ticket?</p>
    <p class="from-them" style="--delay: 30s;">We offer tickets at a flat rate of $100 &#128521;. You can text me "CONFIRM" through this chat, and the transaction amount will be deducted from your phone's wallet. Once we get your confirmation, we will issue you your single-use ticket immediately &#128522;.</p>
    <p class="from-me" style="--delay: 32s;">CONFIRM</p>
    <p class="from-me" style="--delay: 33s;">Thank you!</p>
    <p class="from-them" style="--delay: 35s;">Your ticket is ready. Please visit the train station in your own time.  We're here to make sure it's a journey you'll treasure forever &#128150;. Enjoy your trip down memory lane!</p>
